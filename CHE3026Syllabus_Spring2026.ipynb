        "WHAT IF?  Is a question an engineer should never stop asking.  Any calculation worth doing once in a real engineering situation, is inevitably repeated over and over again for different conditions.  Coding to automate calculations is therefore one of the most valuable engineering skills. We will use Python intensively in this class using Google's Colaboratory Jupyter Notebook environment.  It is recommended to go through the free online resources to brush up on your Python skills:\n",

Success as an engineer comes from persistent attention to detail, desire to learn, and communication skills.  Grading in this course will try to reflect this reality as closely as possible.  There will be ~5 homework problems that require submission of Youtube videos where you present (without looking at notes) solution to problems and write Python code (live) to complete the calculations.<br>\n",

There will be ~5 homework problems that require submission of Youtube videos where you present (without looking at notes) solution to problems and write Python code (live) to complete the calculations.  A confirmed YouTube account is <u>mandatory</u> so you can upload playlists with unlimited length videos.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "You will have ~1.5 weeks to complete each of these multipart videos submitted as YouTube playlists that would range from 30 to 90 minutes long.  Do note that because you are presenting on camera and not allowed to look at notes while you present and write the code, it will take MANY attempts to make a video worthy of submission.  Make your first recording attempt no later than the 3rd day after each part of the HW is assigned.  It will be much harder than you think - do not procrastinate.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you use a pen device to explain/derive relationships and concepts, [this is an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWne17epJ6Y&ab_channel=CharlieCo) of how your recording should be setup.  If you use regular pen/paper, do not be overly concerned with hiding the camera that is used to record the paper.  In this case, it might be preferable to use a whiteboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "When explaining/writing code, 3 simultaneous video streams are necessary.  One camera angle facing you, and another environmental camera angle from behind you that shows at least 2/3 of all monitors and the wall (if any) behind you.  [This is an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J30jzc3DD8&ab_channel=CharlieCo)  of a possible setup.\n",

        "Irrespective of how exactly your videos are recorded, they should provide <u>IRREFUTABLE</u> evidence that the work is not merely being copied and read aloud. Make short practice takes to make sure that you have locked focus/exposure and that handwriting, face, and screen are legible.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each HW part that is submitted correctly there will be a 1 letter grade deduction on the final transcript letter grade for each month past the due date. For example, HW1 Parts A, B, C, D are due on Sep 25. If a student submits HW1 Parts A and B on time, but submits Part C on Oct 26, and Part D on Nov 26, whilst submitting all other homeworks within a month of the due date, the total deduction would result in 1 + 2 = 3 = (A-, B+, B, B-) = B- for the transcript course letter grade. If there are any missing HW parts a day before UC's grade submission deadline, an incomplete grade will be entered. Incomplete grades will be converted to F as deductions accumulate.\n",
